Absolutely — here's a polished, RFI-ready `README.md` that clearly explains what your script does, how to run it, and how it demonstrates your understanding of fingerprint segmentation:

# 🧠 Slap Fingerprint Segmentor – OpenCV CLI Demo

## 📌 Overview

This script (`segmentor.py`) is a **proof-of-concept tool** for segmenting individual fingerprints from a slap image. It mimics the functionality outlined in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) RFI: **Fingerprint Segmentation Software and Capture Analysis**.

It demonstrates:
- Finger contour detection using OpenCV
- Bounding box generation and centroid localization
- Mock NFIQ scoring and angle estimation
- JSON output in a structure compatible with government biometric workflows

## 🧪 Features

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🖼 Input Types | `.png`, `.tif`, `.gray` slap images |
| ✂️ Finger Detection | Contour + morphology-based segmentation |
| 🟩 Bounding Boxes | Drawn around detected fingers (adjustable) |
| 📐 Angle Estimation | From rotated bounding box |
| 🎯 Centroid Calculation | Included per detected finger |
| 🔢 Mock NFIQ Score | Simulated fingerprint quality (1-5) |
| 📝 JSON Output | Per finger: `bbox`, `angle`, `nfiq`, `centroid`, `handedness` |
| 🎨 Annotated Image | Saved with drawn boxes and finger labels |

## 📦 File Structure

```
segmentor.py
└── output/
    ├── mock_slap_segmented.png
    └── mock_slap_segments.json
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.11 & <
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Run segmentation using OpenCV (no ML model needed)
python segmentor.py --input path/to/slap_image.png --output output/
```

```bash
# Optionally: run using YOLO label file (future support)
python segmentor.py --input slap.png --yolo slap_labels.txt
```

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This script shows a practical understanding of:
- Fingerprint image structure (slaps, gray scale)
- Bounding box logic using contours and PCA
- Biometric quality metrics (angle, score, handedness)
- Exporting machine-readable metadata (JSON)

Even though it does not use a trained ML model, it lays the groundwork for integrating one later, with real-time fallback logic via OpenCV.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Integration with NIST NFIQ scoring tools
- Integration with trained YOLOv8 model for accurate segmentation
- Web UI for drag-and-drop demo
- Thumb stitching logic and label-assisted classification
